    "description" : "Constructed all possible combinations of first 5 beneficial mutations to fix in a population of E. coli from a long term evolution experiment. In 20,000 generations, these 5 mutations accounted for ~30% of fitness increase. Grow populations in environment where glucose is the limited resource. Took each mutant and ran direct competition with ancestor, thus having a constant genetic background. Descripted a deleterious epistasis effect, that soudns similar to diminishing/thresholding epistasis.",
